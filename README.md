# codeDomainModel

For the domain model project, we chose to model a trip calculator.

On the simulation page, a dropdown box for the destination is present with a drop down option. The simulator also needs the current location from the user in the form of an interger marking miles he has traveled so far to his destination.  The user will also need to choose any number of combination of points of interests (ie.food, gas, and restroom).

The calculator is limited to a single destination at the moment, but in a real life situation any destination should be possible.  The simulation is also calculating on a linear path and the points of interests are all located on the same path.  In real life, we would be dealing with points off the main path that are close but not on it.
