# codeDomainModel

For the "code domain model" project, Mark and I chose to use his idea. The goal was to model a trip calculator that, with given information from the user, gives results that fit the criteria for what the user is looking for. The calculator is limited to a single destination at the moment, but in a real life situation GPS technology would be utilized to give the user unlimited possibilities. On the simulation page, a dropdown box for the destination is present with the "disney" option. The simulator also needs the current location from the user, which is given number form and the types of stops they want to make(ie.food, gas, and restroom). For the simulation, the trip is always on a linear path, with numbers representing different locations along the path. The calculator takes the user's information and and generates an aswer which is displayed in a box on the page.
